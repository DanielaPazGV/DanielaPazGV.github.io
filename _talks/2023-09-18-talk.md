Poster Presentation at the "65th Meeting of the Argentine Astronomical Association" in San Juan, Argentina, 2023.

The poster delves into the reanalysis of radial velocities for an M dwarf, revealing a fascinating correlation: the stellar rotation period aligns precisely with twice the duration of a detected planetary signal within the habitable zone. This study aims to either affirm or refute the planetary origin of these signals, acknowledging that stellar activity can induce radial velocity variations at the stellar rotation periods and their harmonics.

Our analysis strongly suggests the possibility of a stellar activity origin for the signal. However, to validate this hypothesis, complex models of the time series i crucial. If you require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
