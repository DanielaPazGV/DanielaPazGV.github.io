I am proficient in using programming tools, particularly the Python language for data analysis. Highly willing to develop myself in the pedagogical and research area. Adapted to the use of social networks for the dissemination of knowledge and science in general. Great leadership endorsed by my peers, committed to the development of team projects and willing to develop new skills and knowledge.
