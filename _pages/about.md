### Hi! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2wh8AaMZ2jtRseDQ3C/giphy.gif" width="30">
I'm Daniela Gonz√°lez, an MSc student in Astronomy at the Universidad de Concepci√≥n in Chile. My research focuses on understanding stellar activity and its impact on exoplanet detection ü™ê.

- ‚ú® For my MSc thesis project, I am conducting a comprehensive analysis of Radial Velocity measurements in M-dwarf systems. I am concurrently investigating stellar activity through spectroscopic activity indicators. This aims to either confirm or dismiss potentially ambiguous planetary signals with orbital periods similar to the stellar rotation period. These findings prompt crucial questions about the true origin of the radial velocity variationss initially attributed as planets.

- ‚ú® I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and welcome collaborations. Feel free to reach out via the contact emails provided in the sidebar.

<!-- - üî≠ Currently working on my MSc thesis project, estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBH) using WISE cataloged data for the ngEHT Collaboration, as part of the leo Milenio TITANS group. -->

<!-- - üå± Constantly learning new Machine Learning and AI tools to use in my thesis, related works, and to continue expanding my knowledge. -->
