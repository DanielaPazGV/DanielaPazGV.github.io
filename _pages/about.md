### Hi!ü™ê  
I'm Daniela Gonz√°lez, Msc student in Astrophysics at Universidad de Concepci√≥n, in Chile. I'm interested in stellar activity and their impact on exoplanet detection <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2wh8AaMZ2jtRseDQ3C/giphy.gif" width="30">.

‚ú® My Msc thesis project consist on the analysis of Radial Velocity measurements of M-dwarfs systems alongside the analysis of stellar activity through spectroscopic activity indicators in order to confirm or dismiss dubious planetary signals that have orbital periods similar to the stellar rotation period, raising question about the real origin of the radial velocity measurements attributed as planets.

‚ú® I'm always grateful for expanding my knowledge and have collaborations. My contact mails are on the side bar.

<!-- - üî≠ Currently working on my MSc thesis project, estimating the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBH) using WISE cataloged data for the ngEHT Collaboration, as part of the leo Milenio TITANS group. -->

<!-- - üå± Constantly learning new Machine Learning and AI tools to use in my thesis, related works, and to continue expanding my knowledge. -->
